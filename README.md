**_Description:_** This project is one of our bootcamp tasks about the basics of HTML. Basically, the task is to create a website by only using a table. 

My approach on this one (as discussed on its about section) is that I used 100% width for the table and divided it into 20 equal columns that served as grids for my layout. I also used basic styling on this one to make it little more presentable.

The downside of this project is that it does not look good on mobile devices. However, that is not a part of this activity so (this is supposed to be a quick one) so I did not make it to be as responsive as possible.
